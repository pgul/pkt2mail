0a. make sure you have both smapi and fidoconfig libraries installed and
    working. At least, fidoconfig 0.91 is needed
0b. also, you will need huskymak.cfg that comes with husky-common.tar.gz
    to compile

1.  put the pkt2mail package in the directory where the other packages of fido
    linux reside:

       /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                                 -> fidoconfig/
                                 -> pkt2mail/

2.  if you have your main fidoconfig file outside /etc/fido edit pkt2mail.h
    and change the #define's to fit your needs

3.  make, install and/or clean:
	$ make
	# make install
	$ make clean
	
    Compiling pkt2mail without husky support makes no sense, so be sure to
    use makefile.husky as the main makefile. 

4.  Configure it. Details can be found in README.
