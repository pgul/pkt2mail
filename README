PKT-TO-MAIL v0.1
----------------

This program will use a MTA (for example sendmail) for sending mime encoded
packets of any FTN, from a Binkley Style Outbound. It needs a working version
of fidoconfig (v0.91) and smapilnx to compile.

To get it running, first install it. See INSTALL for details.


Config
------

Once you have the binary, you should configure it. To do so, go to your
fidoconfig file, and add the string Email to each link you want to route
by email. Say, for example, you want to send your pkts to your boss via
email because he lives too far away from you, and don't want to pay long
distance bills. Put this line in his link definition in your config file:

Link    Your boss' name
Aka     1:2/3
ourAka  1:2/3.4
Email   hismail@address.com

The other file to change, 'pkt2mail.msg' is the text that will appear in the
body of the message. If the receiving system uses an automated email system
(like mail2pkt, transnet or fido2int) it will ignore it, but when mailing a
non automated system, this text will make sense.


Notes
-----

PKT2MAIL will process each link that finds in fidoconfig. If it finds an
echomail hold flavour, it won't mail anything. So, if you don't want to
process a link, wether don't put his email address in your fidoconfig file or,
mark his echomail flavour as hold in fidoconfig.

Actually, when sending netmail packets, only crash packets are mailed. However,
this may change in the future.


Feedback
--------

I wanna know who's using my program, so please write me. I hope to hear back
from you.
