PKT-TO-MAIL v0.2
----------------

 This program will use a MTA (for example sendmail) for sending out mime encoded
 packets of any FTN, from a Binkley Style Outbound. This is good when you have
 a link that lives in another city or even another country, and he (or you)
 can't have a full time binkd running, or whatever. This way, you can exchange
 packets without paying long distance bills nor being all the day on-line.
 
 To get it running, first install it. See INSTALL for details.


Config
------

 Once you have the binary, you should configure the program. To do so, go to
 your fidoconfig file, and add the string Email to each link you want to route
 by email. Say, for example, zyou want to send your pkts to your boss via
 email. Put this line in his link definition in your config file:

---cut---cut---
Link    Your boss' name
Aka     1:2/3
ourAka  1:2/3.4
Email   hismail@address.com
---cut---cut---

 The other file you should change, 'pkt2mail.msg' is the text that will
 appear in the body of the message. If the receiving system uses an automated
 email system (like mail2pkt, transnet or fido2int) it will ignore it, but
 when mailing a non automated system, this text will make sense to the human
 that receives the mail.


Notes
-----

 Pkt2mail will process each link that finds in fidoconfig that has the 'normal'
 echomail flavour. So, if a link has a crash flavour, your mailer (BT/XE for
 example) will call him. If he has hold, it is supposed that your link will
 call you, so pkt2mail won't mail anything.
 If you don't want to process a link and even mark his files as normal, don't
 put his email address in your fidoconfig file.

 Actually, when sending netmail packets, only crash packets are mailed. However,
 this may change in the future.


Feedback
--------

 I wanna know who's using my program, so please write me. I hope to hear back
 from you.
